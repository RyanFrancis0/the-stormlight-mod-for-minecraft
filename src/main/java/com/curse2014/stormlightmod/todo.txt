This is the real short term document to help me think



one place for stormlight effects. should be the player ontick

Fixes:
- fix breathing underwater (server?)
    - cliet server thing killing me
    - figure out what is going on with stormlight
- fix blade bonding
    - ability to unbond in which case CAN Drop it as an item
each entity has a data manager it can get and set to

- reread forge doc on gettting started: sides
- networking
- packets
- capabilities
"By default, capability data is not sent to clients. In order to change this, the mods have to manage their own synchronization code using packets.
There are three different situations in which you may want to send synchronization packets, all of them optional:
When the entity spawns in the world, or the block is placed, you may want to share the initialization-assigned values with the clients.
When the stored data changes, you may want to notify some or all of the watching clients.
When a new client starts viewing the entity or block, you may want to notify it of the existing data."
"By default, the capability data does not persist on death. In order to change this, the data has to be manually copied when the player entity
 is cloned during the respawn process.
 This can be done via PlayerEvent$Clone by reading the data from the original entity and assigning it to the new entity.
 In this event, the wasDead field can be used to distinguish between respawning after death and returning from the End.
 This is important because the data will already exist when returning from the End, so care has to be taken to not duplicate values in this case."
