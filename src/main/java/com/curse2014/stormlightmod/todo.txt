This is the real short term document to help me think

JESUS CHRIST I had no idea how much work goes into even a s***** mod.
    - like seriously 1 entity needs a huge deal about it
    -

- spren x 1 (x9)
- surges x 10
- polestones x 10 == 64 all up.
    - ores x10
        - create new class for each
    - pieces x30
        - create new class for pieces. have size small, middle, large. and ofc type
    - spheres x24
    - for each item added
        - texture
        - model
        - lang_us
        - register
- advancements (x3)
    - should be pretty easy actually
- testing (x all of above)

/*
    "By default, capability data is not sent to clients. In order to change this, the mods have to manage their own synchronization code using packets.
    There are three different situations in which you may want to send synchronization packets, all of them optional:
    When the entity spawns in the world, or the block is placed, you may want to share the initialization-assigned values with the clients.
    When the stored data changes, you may want to notify some or all of the watching clients.
    When a new client starts viewing the entity or block, you may want to notify it of the existing data."
    "By default, the capability data does not persist on death. In order to change this, the data has to be manually copied when the player entity
     is cloned during the respawn process.
     This can be done via PlayerEvent$Clone by reading the data from the original entity and assigning it to the new entity.
     In this event, the wasDead field can be used to distinguish between respawning after death and returning from the End.
     This is important because the data will already exist when returning from the End, so care has to be taken to not duplicate values in this case."

Fixes:
- fix blade bonding
    - ability to unbond in which case CAN Drop it as an item

- make it have splash damage. does it already have it?


Nextses:
- spren
- orders
- surges
- oath advancement

Eventually:
CanyonWorldCarver, ConfiguredCarver, ChunkGenerator. I think need set probability in configured carver to a low number to get a high amount of canyons.
