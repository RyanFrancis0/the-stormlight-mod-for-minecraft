So eventually I want the full shebang, fullblown cosmere.

But in the meantime a list helps (as does a focus on SA):

B is a good idea machine!
Important tenets to remember:
    1. that the game needs to be fun to play
        1.1 and QUICKLY
        - So this is an adaption of cosmere universe, not an implementation.
    2. needs to be interesting for devs
        - biggest threat to project is inevitable loss of time and interest
        - so don't spend a month just figuring out how to implement wind you'll inevitably hate it
        - find someone to to textures/models as you really hate that stuff and aren't good at design anyway
        - get public server going
        ! get community behind this to keep me honest
            - fb
        - find someone to do a wiki, you hate that too
            - ugh but you kind of have to be involved. nah i dont, someonell figure it out.
    - need to colour in the edges of world to get immersion
        - e.g. speech banks, animals (lot o spren), structures (architectures), npcs (fashions), biomes (plants)
    - want it to stay reasonably minecraftian
        - mining should be NECESSARY every so often
            - at this stage all I can think of is make it only reasonable way to get spheres (ingredients to make them)

* MVP
    - on log in, if no spren, gen generic spren buddy and have chat msg "You notice a _ spren nearby. It seems to be following you around..."
        - on rclkc should go "_ spren: Speak again the ancient oaths <username>"
    - surges
    - shardblade
    - most polestone ores, craftable into spheres
        - perhaps to keep self interested do 1 polestone set after each surge
    - once complete the end get random spren of different type and reset all oaths
        - chat msg "Congrats on beating the game. I thought here at the end of all things you might appreciate a new beginning? Please accept a reset spren of a random different type."
        - no don't do this. let players create new worlds and try their luck
            - but they may want to try different powers in the exact same world. They've probably put a lot of work into the world. Put a lot of work into getting surges.
            - actually yeah I stand by this. PLayers will want diff powers in same world. Ender dragon good way to reset too.

* spren
    - all 10 main ones spawn reasonably frequently near unbonded players
        - maybe parrot behaviour just to begin with
        - the other ones will take FOREVER to do
    - bond by typing out 3 oathes in succession. (rclk, or feed stormlight? to get spren 'ready')
    - once bonded gets named by you "I... almost...remember... I had a name once, what was it?"
    - follows you around
    - invincible
    - when you die it dies (forever) and drops as a dead shard blade that any1 but u can pick up.
        - msg life before death appears on death gui
    - exponentialy increasing wait time between bonding new spren
        - challene of letting people try out diff orders. need fiure out appropriate cost

* shardblades
    - not normally placeable but eventually someway definitely able to place as 2x1 block entity (like armourstand) face down in stone
    - cannot drop, be placed in item frame, or placed in a non player inventory.
    - Maybe make shardblade slower than normal sword?
    - always drop on player death
    - if not radiant:
        - if do held rclc like food should 'unbond' and drop.

* shardplate
    - jumping 2 boost
        - pants and boots?
    - maximum possible armour value
    - resistance 2 effect when all armour on
    - if is 'live' some way to toggle visibility? would become visible on someone attcking the player. long way down track.

* spheres
    - sphere chalice (glass in a u) that store spheres and be placed
    - sphere pouch (8 slots spheres only). rclk lets draim like regular sphere (but ofc drains all spheres in there)
    - 10 ores, all release one fleck. 9 flecks to make

* 10 orders:
    - unlocking oaths
        - fulfilling one won't unlock it unless all previous unlocked
        - 1st oath
            - instantly accepted by spren. just say in chat "Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."
                - HUD bar will appear. msg or eventually advancement will say what happenned
        - 2nd and 3rd oaths should be time consuming but entertaining, reasonably easy to just speedrun to
        - second oath
            - go to nether fortress
        - third oath
            - diamonds
        - 4th oath
            - defeat ender dragon
        - 5th oath
            - unknown. nothing yet to unlock anyway.
    - two quick access keys (if surge requires that)
        - 'v' - the quickest
        - 'x' - if other surge also needs key access
    - some orders (but try most) will have passive stormlight effects

                - climbing walls like spider (speed stops ?)
                - (dustbringer) walk through water speed

            - illumination
                - in anvil, put block item in prime slot, sphere in secondary slot
                - creates stormlight_ version of that block.
                - generate stack of quantity depending on amount of stormlight in sphere
                - each placed block drains stormlight from user until:
                    - the user breaks it (let's do instant break by user)
                        - other players can't break it, but placing a real block 'on' it will instead replace that block
                    - the user moves away (tricky, let's say) > ~4 chunks.
                        - if user logs out that destroys illusion. want to avoid creating a fake account and never logging in again hack.
                    - the user runs out of stormlight
                - while a bock is placed and being funded user will not suffer normal drain or generate particles
        - passive effect
                - (progression) regen 2
                - (illumination) 'v' key to toggle invisibility (will stop generate particle too. but still drain like normal)

        - surges
            - transformation
                - hold 'x' to teleport to shadesmare (1 way, virtually full player stormlight required and consumed)
                    - portal gui like nether portal, it's not instantaneous.
                        - ooh could start draining more stormlight while portal animation going on, so have to be sucking in from sphere while doing it
                -
            - illumination
                - see above
        - passive effect

        - surges
            - transformation
                - see above
                - quote saying elsecallers more skilled at this than lightweavers so perhaps reduced restrictions/costs
            - transportation
                - can at any point in shadesmar return to roshar (or normal world)
                    - perhaps 19 in 20 chance of failing (no large instant consumption of investiture though)
                - in interest of fairness need something more from this:
                    - may need to not allow lightweavers to go to shadesmare. or perhaps lightweavers need restrictive stormlight cost to do it.
        - passive effect
                -

    * willshapers
        - oaths
            - 1st oath

            - conhesion
                - 'v'
                    - can only toggle when standing on a stone block (or rock like block) (or maybe preserve has to be stone)
                    - stone appears in empty air beneath player, consumes stormlight and stone from inventory
                        - will need to disable fravity on player while happenning
                        - so allows for a sort of proto flight
                        - perhaps standing next to stone alright otherwise hard to get down
                        - perhaps shift create stone steps going downwards in direction of movement
                            - perhaps diagonal y movement always steps
                - can instant destroy stone
                - in an anvil can use stormlight to double a stone stack (or perhaps just need 1 stone block)
                    - and double other blocks made out of stone or any kind of cobble? or even detritus stone?
            - transportation
                - see above
        - passive effect
                ? resistance 1?

                - 'x'
                    - perhaps while toggled add protection enchantments to worn armour (inclusind shardplate?) and attack to weapon/tool in main hand (including shardblade?)
                        - might be too OP for all stonewards to be superior in a fight with other orders. multiplayer will get frustrated
                        - (not sharpness to swords, as shardbaldes renders that redundant)
                        - (not generic protection as shardplate renders that redundant)
        - passive effect
                - strength 2
                ? resistance 1 ?

    * bondsmiths
        - get no spren or shardblade
        - only 3 allowed in any given server/world at a time (1 for each spren)
            - cmds can remove. so pretty much server owner in control of that
        - oaths
            - 1st oath

            - tension
                - in anvil use sphere in second slot to use stormlight to repair an item
        - 'v'
            - can in a radius around them ~4 chunks (?) start recharging spheres (incl own inventory)
                - skybeam on player when they do (thank you minecraft)
                - can only do when on full light
                - immediately stop draining spheres
                - when depleted of stormlight
        - 'rclk':
            - when right click a player who has a spren progress them to the next oath
                - only on full light, and consumes all of it
            - when right click an aggressive mob change it's behaviour to passive
                - will persist even if mob attacked? no, will need to rclkc again
                - constant drain till stops.
                - stops when mob dies or right clicked again
                - at which point if normal behavoiur aggressive will become aggressive again
        - "A knowledgeable Bondsmith may directly manipulate more specialized Connections to steal something like a Nahel bond, the mantle of a champion, strength, Breaths, the ability to use Allomancy, etc"
            - perhaps give access to certain custom created cmds.
                - such as drain a player of all stormlight
        - stormfather:
            - gets benefit of stormlight
            - create portal blocks to shadesmare? infringes on transportation though so I think not.
        - sibling
            - invulnerable while in urithiru biome?
            - or perhaps gets all positive effects while there
        - nightwatcher:
            - boon and curse
                - perhaps I'll add rando boon-curses pairs to nightwatcher bondsmith powers in future updates when I feel like it
                    - e.g. "sight": ability to anoint players who every nights gets nightvision, but every day has blindness
                    - e.g. "aging": ability to anoint players who gets stormlight when consumes food, but can't gain/hold/use experience points/bar anymore
                    - will require said players consent prior to giving them this. But dont have to tell them which one/ any detials.

* chasm fiend
    - mini boss
    - drops perfect gemstone as reward (kown as _ drop)
    - should pretty much need the damage and reach of a shardblade to attack, maybe the protection of plate to properly battle with
    - invulnerable to arrows? or takes way less damage (unless you trap it somehow?)
    - enderdragon's ability to destroy most blocks adjacent to it?
    - should do knockback/throw player into air like that one mob im thinking of
    - good reach and as fast as non sprinting player
    - rarish, generate below certain block level in shattered plains, with right space and light level
        - then would be real vulnerable to falling lava or bow shots, or drowning, or falling gravel/sand
            - probably best to make it invulnerable to those then

* shattered plains biome
    - badlands with really ramped up chasms/canyons spawning rate
    - alethi and parshendi spawn randomly here, as do their structures
        - althi have 10 skin types, and kholin and sadeas ones sometimes break into fights

* highstorm
    - once every 2 minecraft days
    - just starts out as thunder at beginning as wind CRAZY hard to insert into mc
    - shudder to think about moving it across roshar dimension

* shadesmar dimension
    - tieing it to overworld layout will take a while to figure out/implement
        - so to begin with will just generate randomly

* when game getting over/raeched highest power creep
    - braze dimension

* eating cake gives just a little stormlight
    - yay easter eggs
