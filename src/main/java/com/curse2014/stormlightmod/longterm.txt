So eventually I want the full shebang, fullblown cosmere.

But in the meantime a list helps (as does a focus on SA):

B is a good idea machine!
Important tenets to remember:
    1. that the game needs to be fun to play
        1.1 and QUICKLY
        - So this is an adaption of cosmere universe, not an implementation.
    2. needs to be interesting for devs
        - biggest threat to project is inevitable loss of time and interest
        - so don't spend a month just figuring out how to implement wind you'll inevitably hate it
        - find someone to do textures/models as you really hate that stuff and aren't good at design anyway
        - get public server going
        ! get community behind this to keep me honest
            - fb
        - find someone to do a wiki, you hate that too
            - ugh but you kind of have to be involved. nah i dont, someonell figure it out.
    - need to colour in the edges of world to get immersion
        - e.g. speech banks, animals (lot o spren), structures (architectures), npcs (fashions), biomes (plants)
    - want it to stay reasonably minecraftian
        - mining should be NECESSARY every so often
            - at this stage all I can think of is make it only reasonable way to get spheres (ingredients to make them)

* MVP (The Stormlight Mod for Minecraft Beta v 1.0.0)
    - on log in, if no spren, gen generic spren buddy and have chat msg "You notice a _ spren nearby. It seems to be following you around..."
        - on rclkc should go "_ spren: Speak again the ancient oaths <username>"
    - surges
    - shardblade
    - most polestone ores, craftable into spheres
        - perhaps to keep self interested do 1 polestone set after each surge
    - once complete the end get random spren of different type and reset all oaths
        - chat msg "Congrats on beating the game. I thought here at the end of all things you might appreciate a new beginning? Please accept a reset spren of a random different type."
        - no don't do this. let players create new worlds and try their luck
            - but they may want to try different powers in the exact same world. They've probably put a lot of work into the world. Put a lot of work into getting surges.
            - actually yeah I stand by this. PLayers will want diff powers in same world. Ender dragon good way to reset too.
        - OR Drop an honourblade that isn't bonded to player

* spren
    - 	So atm, I don't need to store jack about spren in player info. name is order
        - player probs want nametag though
    - all 10 main ones spawn reasonably frequently near unbonded players
        - maybe parrot behaviour just to begin with
        - the other ones will take FOREVER to do
    - bond by typing out 1st oath. (rclk, or feed stormlight? to get spren 'ready')
    - once bonded gets named by you "I... almost...remember... I had a name once, what was it?"
    - follows you around
    - invincible
    - when you die it dies (forever) and (if uve unlocked it as shardblade) it drops as a dead shard blade that any1 but u can pick up.
        - msg life before death appears on death gui
    - exponentialy increasing wait time between bonding new spren
        - challene of letting people try out diff orders. need fiure out appropriate cost

* shardblades
    - not normally placeable but eventually someway definitely able to place as 2x1 block entity (like armourstand) face down in stone
    - cannot drop, be placed in item frame, or placed in a non player inventory.
    - Maybe make shardblade slower than normal sword?
    - always drop as dead variant on player death
    - if not radiant:
        - if do held rclc like food should 'unbond' and drop.
    - honourblades
        - only get powers while in active hand. hmm or in inventory rather
            - while in inventory must use those powers
    - can only have 1 bonded shardblade in inventory at a time
        - dismissal and summoning rotates through them
        - eventually will need to make a menu i guess

* shardplate
    - maximum possible armour value
    - when all armour on
        - jumping boost + 1
        - resistance + 3
        - strength + 1 ?
        - absorption + 4
    - always drop as dead variant on player death
    - if dead can be repaired in anvil with sphere
    - if live doesnt take damage
    - if is 'live' some way to toggle visibility? would become visible when player takes damage. long way down track.

* spheres
    - sphere chalice (glass in a u) that store spheres and be placed
    - sphere pouch (8 slots spheres only). rclk lets draim like regular sphere (but ofc drains all spheres in there)
    - 10 ores, all release one fleck. 9 flecks to make

* 10 orders:
    - unlocking oaths
        - fulfilling one won't unlock it unless all previous unlocked
        - seeing as how a lot of orders have oaths that don't "unlock" anything I might unlock passive effects in there instead
        - 1st oath
            - instantly accepted by spren. just say in chat "Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."
                - HUD bar will appear. msg or eventually advancement will say what happenned
        - 2nd and 3rd oaths should be time consuming but entertaining, reasonably easy to just speedrun to
        - second oath
            - go to nether fortress
        - third oath
            - diamonds
        - 4th oath
            - defeat ender dragon
        - 5th oath
            - unknown. nothing yet to unlock anyway.
    - two quick access keys (if surge requires that)
        - 'v' - the quickest
        - 'x' - if other surge also needs key access

    * windrunners
        - oaths
            - 1st oath
                - unlock stormlight and gravitation and adhesion
            - 2nd oath
                - nothing (passive gravitation)
            - 3rd oath
                - unlock shardblade
            - 4th oath
                - unlock shardplate
            - 5th oath
                - unknown
        - surges
            - adhesion
                - sticking things together ("full lashing")
                - need to be somethingaight to seperate from skybreakers
            - gravitation (arbitrarily setting this to 'v' surge)
                - player.addVelocity(flightPath.x, flightPath.y, flightPath.z);//flightpath being a scaled vector. this could accelerate you orrr
                - might be best to do tap into the horse jup bar to get speed to accelerate to
                    - maybe max is as fast as powered rail cos stuff spawns slow
                    - ClientPlayerEntity. scroll to below section. looks like know when space held and can accumulate, so perhaps adapt that to v
                        if (this.isRidingHorse()) {
                               IJumpingMount ijumpingmount = (IJumpingMount)this.getRidingEntity();
                     - how then to disable? if less than 2 seconds or 1 second? PLayers would prefer an indicator of that.
                - can accelerate in pointing direction
                - can change gravity of a block or an itementity
                    - if not of type plant?
        - passive effect
                - (gravitation) slow falling. or perhaps jump boost + 1. jump bost really makes no sense

    * skybreakers
        - oaths
            - 1st oath
                - nothing
            - 2nd oath
                - unlock stormlight and graviation
            - 3rd oath
                - unlock division and shardblade
            - 4th oath
                - unlock squires
            - 5th oath
                - unknown (but shardplate amiright)
        - surges
            - division ('rclkc' surge)
                - create explosion around thing you rclkcd (that does not harm user)
                    - can also use jump bar so long as both not using bar at same time
                        - I think jump bar still works, as long as sucking in stormlight?
                            - jump bar either way does slow down attack capabilities/usefulness
                            - brainstorm alternatives
                                - bow and arrow but launch explosion
                                - maybe just drain up to a certain amount of stormlight on rclkc
            - gravitation ('v')
                - see above
        - passive effect
                - (division) haste 1 ('x')
                - (gravitation) see above

    * dustbringers (releasers)
        - oaths
            - 1st oath
                - unknown (stormlight and abrasion)
            - 2nd oath
                - unknown (passive abrasion)
            - 3rd oath
                - unlock division and (presumably) shardblade
            - 4th oath
                - unknown (shardplate)
            - 5th oath
                - unknown
        - surges
            - division ('rclk')
                - see above
            - abrasion ('v')
                - preserve momentum till hit something (no slowdown due to friction/wind resistance). would also lose ability to change direction until clicked v again
                    - might be able to increase speed and add slipperiness without speed effect
                    - tricky cos I'm skipping a wee bit of code b4 travel
                    - in tick execute last part of living entity travel with custom slipperiness
                    - if (!this.isElytraFlying() && ((!this.isInWater() && this.isInLava()!) || this instanceof PlayerEntity && ((PlayerEntity)this).abilities.isFlying)) {

                - see above
            - illumination
                - in anvil, put block item in prime slot, sphere in secondary slot
                - creates stormlight_ version of that block.
                - generate stack of quantity depending on amount of stormlight in sphere (up to 64 ofc)
                    - cannot leave inventory unless placing

                - each placed block drains stormlight from user until:
                    - the user breaks it (let's do instant break by user)
                    - a real block is placed 'on' it (will replace that block)
                    - the user moves away (tricky, let's say) > ~4 chunks.
                    - the user logs out. want to avoid creating a fake account and never logging in again hack.
                    - the user runs out of stormlight.
                - while a bock is placed and being funded user will not suffer normal drain or generate particles
                - perhaps eventually rclkc a player or mob (perhaps while holding book and quill or painting) to outwardly look like that mob, till hit or run out of stormlight (no additional drain) or logs out
                    - this would replace invisibility
        - passive effect
                - (progression) regen 2 ('x')
                - (illumination) invisibility ('v') (will stop generate particle too. but still drain like normal)

                    - hold 'x' to teleport to shadesmare (1 way, virtually full player stormlight required and consumed)
                        - portal gui like nether portal, it's not instantaneous.
                            - ooh could start draining more stormlight while portal animation going on, so have to be sucking in from sphere while doing it
                    - maybe appear in shadesmare as spectator mode?
                - in anvil put sphere item in prime slot. it can be used 5 times for chips, 10 for marks, 15 for broams.
                - converts stormlight to item 1:1 (up to a stack each use)
                - perhaps eventually transform blocks into other blocks if holding sphere with enough stormlght
                    - do that in shadesmare somehow?
                    - could be OP to transform another player's abse into fire

                - can at any point in shadesmare return to roshar (or normal world)
                    - perhaps 19 in 20 chance of failing (no large instant consumption of investiture though, just player frustration and complaints about being "stuck")
                - in interest of fairness need something more from this:
                    - may need to not allow lightweavers to go to shadesmare. or perhaps lightweavers need restrictive stormlight cost to do it.
                - perhaps in lieu of , can teleport in direction of eyeline (highest y of block yay away)
                    - get jump bar back like windrunners

                - can only toggle when standing on a stone block (or rock like block) (or maybe preserve has to be stone)
                - stone appears in empty air beneath player, consumes stormlight and stone from inventory
                    - will need to disable gravity on player while happenning
                    - so allows for a sort of proto flight
                    - perhaps standing next to stone alright otherwise hard to get down
                    - perhaps shift create stone steps going downwards in direction of movement
                        - perhaps diagonal y movement always steps
                        - but can't sneak off a square
                - can instant destroy stone
                - not 'v' in an anvil can 1:1 covert stormlight to stone (at least 1 stone in prime slot, sphere in secondary)
                    - and double other blocks made out of stone or any kind of cobble? or even detritus stone?
            - transportation
                - see above
        - passive effect
                - (cohesion) + 1 resistance

    * stonewards
        - oaths
            - 1st oath
                - unknown (stormlight and cohesion)
            - 2nd oath
                - unknown (tension)
            - 3rd oath
                - unknown (shardblade)
            - 4th oath
                - unknown (but shardplate amiright)
            - 5th oath
                - unknown
        - surges
            - conhesion
                - see above
            - tension ('x')
                - "alter the stiffness of an object" "allowing them to harden clothing into weapons"
                - perhaps while toggled add protection enchantments to worn armour (including shardplate?) and attack to weapon/tool in main hand (including shardblade?)
                    - might be too OP for all stonewards to be superior in a fight with other orders. multiplayer will get frustrated
                    - (not sharpness to swords, as shardbaldes renders that redundant)
                    - (not generic protection as shardplate renders that redundant)
        - passive effect
                - (tension) + 1 strength
                - (cohension) + 1 resistance

    * bondsmiths
        - get no spren or shardblade
        - only 3 allowed in any given server/world at a time (1 for each spren)
            - cmds set. so pretty much server owner in control of that
        - oaths
            - 1st oath
                - light and 'v'
            - 2nd oath
                - unknown (adhesion and 'rclk')
            - 3rd oath
                - unknown (tension)
            - 4th oath
                - unknown (but shardplate amiright)
            - 5th oath
                - unknown
        - surges
            - adhesion
                - see above
                    - whatever windrunners can do with full lashing bondsmiths can also do
            - tension
                - in anvil use sphere in second slot to use stormlight to repair an item
        - 'v'
            - can in a radius around them ~4 chunks (?) start recharging spheres (incl own inventory)
                - skybeam on player when they do (thank you minecraft)
                - can only do when on full light
                - immediately stop draining spheres
                - when depleted of stormlight
        - 'rclk':
            - when right click a player who has a spren progress them to the next oath
                - only on full light, and consumes all of it
            - when right click an aggressive mob change it's behaviour to passive
                - will persist even if mob attacked? no, will need to rclkc again
                - constant drain till stops.
                - stops when mob dies or right clicked again or run out of stormlight
                - at which point behaviour will reset (so if normal behavoiur aggressive will become aggressive again)
        - "A knowledgeable Bondsmith may directly manipulate more specialized Connections to steal something like a Nahel bond, the mantle of a champion, strength, Breaths, the ability to use Allomancy, etc"
            - perhaps give access to certain custom created cmds.
                - such as drain a player of all stormlight
        - stormfather:
            - gets benefit of stormlight
            - create portal blocks to shadesmare? infringes on transportation though so I think not.
        - sibling
            - invulnerable while in urithiru biome?
            - or perhaps gets all positive effects while there
        - nightwatcher:
            - boon and curse
                - perhaps I'll add rando boon-curses pairs to nightwatcher bondsmith powers in future updates when I feel like it
                    - e.g. "sight": ability to anoint players who every nights gets nightvision, but every day has blindness
                    - e.g. "aging": ability to anoint players who gets stormlight when consumes food, but can't gain/hold/use experience points/bar anymore
                    - will require said players consent prior to giving them this. But dont have to tell them which one/ any detials.

* chasm fiend
    - mini boss
    - drops perfect gemstone as reward (known as _ drop)
    - should pretty much need the damage and reach of a shardblade to attack, maybe the protection of plate to properly battle with
    - enderdragon's ability to destroy most blocks adjacent to it?
    - should do knockback/throw player into air like hog
    - good reach and as fast as sprinting player
    - rarish, generate below certain block level in shattered plains, with right space and light level
        - then would be real vulnerable to falling lava or bow shots, or drowning, or falling gravel/sand, thrown potions
            - probably best to make it invulnerable to those then

* shattered plains biome
    - badlands with really ramped up chasms/canyons spawning rate
    - alethi and parshendi spawn randomly here, as do their structures
        - althi have 10 skin types, and kholin and sadeas ones sometimes break into fights

* highstorm
    - once every 2 minecraft days
    - just starts out as thunder at beginning as wind CRAZY hard to insert into mc
    - shudder to think about moving it across roshar dimension
    - so currently lightning is 1/10000 ticks in render distance of player if is thundering and raining
        - so I reckon I dd my own 1 in 1000 during highstorm
        - can just check time, if in window make sure raining and thundering and then throw in some lightning bolts
        - may need to send to client (check)

* shadesmar dimension
    - tieing it to overworld layout will take a while to figure out/implement
        - so to begin with will just generate randomly

* when game getting over/raeched highest power creep
    - braze dimension

* eating cake gives just a little stormlight
    - yay easter eggs
