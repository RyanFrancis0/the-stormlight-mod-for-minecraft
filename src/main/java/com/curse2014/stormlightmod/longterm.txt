So eventually I want the full shebang, fullblown cosmere.

But in the meantime a list helps (as does a focus on SA):

B is a good idea machine!
Important tenets to remember:
    1. that the game needs to be fun to play
        1.1 and QUICKLY
        - So this is an adaption of cosmere universe, not an implementation.
    2. needs to be interesting for devs
        - biggest threat to project is inevitable loss of time and interest
        - so don't spend a month just figuring out how to implement wind you'll inevitably hate it
        - find someone to to textures/models as you really hate that stuff and aren't good at design anyway
    - need to colour in the edges of world to get immersion
        - e.g. speech banks, animals (lot o spren), structures (architectures), npcs (fashions), biomes (plants)
    - want it to stay reasonably minecraftian
        - mining should be NECESSARY every so often
            - at this stage all I can think of is make it only reasonable way to get spheres (ingredients to make them)

* spren
    - all 10 main ones spawn reasonably frequently near unbonded players
        - maybe parrot behaviour just to begin with
        - the other ones will take FOREVER to do
    - bond by typing out 3 oathes in succession. (rclk, or feed stormlight? to get spren 'ready')
    - once bonded gets named by you "I... almost...remember... I had a name once, what was it?"
    - follows you around
    - invincible
    - when you die it dies (forever) and drops as a dead shard blade that any1 but u can pick up.
        - msg life before death appears on death gui
    - exponentialy increasing wait time between bonding new spren
        - challene of letting people try out diff orders. need fiure out appropriate cost

* shardblades
    - not normally placeable but eventually someway definitely able to place as 2x1 block entity (like armourstand) face down in stone

* chasm fiend
    - mini boss
    - drops perfect gemstone as reward

* shattered plains biome
    - badlands with really ramped up chasms/canyons spawning rate
    - alethi and parshendi spawn randomly here, as do their structures
        - althi have 10 skin types, and kholin and sadeas ones sometimes break into fights

* willshaper
    - heal enitities w/ stormlight
    - increased speed and can climb walls like spider

* lightweaver
    - can transform stormlight into stack of light blocks
        - some way to alter them to desired texture
        - light blocks not solid
        - some way to link to gemstone (downtrack)
    - in an anvil can exchange stormlight to transform stone into bread (and so forth)
    - sticks do LARGE amount of dmg, maybe sets lightweavers on fire too

* windrunners
    - can accelerate in pointing direction
        - minecraft gravity so dang strong, maybe slow falling effect?
    - can change gravity of a block or an itementity
        - if not of type plant?

* destroucto ones
    - can create mini explosion they're not damaged by
    - increase strength (maybe resistance too?)

* elsecallers
    - can transform stormlight into temporary portal blocks only you can use
        - if place 2x1 can walkthrough to shadesmar dimension
        - very expensive
        - need portal blocks to get back home, so it is hard to get back

* bondsmiths
    - can in a radius around them start recharging spheres like highstorm
        - skybeam on player when they do (thank you minecraft)

* highstorm
    - once every 2 minecraft days
    - just starts out as thunder at beginning as wind CRAZY hard to insert into mc
    - shudder to think about moving it across roshar dimension

* shadesmar dimension
    - tieing it to overworld layout will take a while to figure out/implement
        - so to begin with will just generate randomly

* when game getting over/raeched highest power creep
    - braze dimension
